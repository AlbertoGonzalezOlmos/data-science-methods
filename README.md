# Predicting rainfall the next day

Example use of basic machine learning classifiers to predict whether there will be rain the following day, using a rainfall dataset from the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology.

After cleaning the data, different classification algorithms as well as accuracy metrics are compared in ther performance to classify the data.

Classification algorithms used to build the models:

1.  Linear Regression
2.  KNN
3.  Decision Trees
4.  Logistic Regression
5.  SVM


The results are reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

1. Accuracy Score
2. Jaccard Index
3. F1-Score
4. LogLoss
5. Mean Absolute Error
6. Mean Squared Error
7. R2-Score
